'''5. There are two circles C1 with radius r1, central coordinate (x1, y1) and C2 with radius r2 and central coordinate (x2, y2).
Write a Python program to test the followings -
"C2 is in C1" if C2 is in C1
"C1 is in C2" if C1 is in C2
"Circumference of C1 and C2 intersect" if circumference of C1 and C2 intersect, and
"C1 and C2 do not overlap" if C1 and C2 do not overlap.
Input:
Input numbers (real numbers) are separated by a space.
Input x1, y1, r1, x2, y2, r2:
5 6 4 8 7 9
C1 is in C2'''

import math
print("Input x1, y1, r1, x2, y2, r2:")
x1,y1,r1,x2,y2,r2 = [float(i) for i in input().split()]
d = math.sqrt((x1-x2)**2 + (y1-y2)**2)
if d < r1-r2:
    print("C2  is in C1")
elif d < r2-r1:
    print("C1  is in C2")
elif d > r1+r2:
    print("Circumference of C1  and C2  intersect")
else:
    print("C1 and C2  do not overlap")
