'''7. Write a Python program to find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 'poor' from a given string, if 'not' follows the 'poor', replace the whole 'not'...'poor' substring with 'good'. Return the resulting string. 
    Sample String : 'The lyrics is not that poor!'
    'The lyrics is poor!'
    Expected Result : 'The lyrics is good!'
    'The lyrics is poor!' '''

def not_poor(str1):
  snot = str1.find('not')
  spoor = str1.find('poor')
  

  if spoor > snot and snot>0 and spoor>0:
    str1 = str1.replace(str1[snot:(spoor+4)], 'good')
    return str1
  else:
    return str1
print(not_poor('The lyrics is not that poor!'))
print(not_poor('The lyrics is poor!'))
