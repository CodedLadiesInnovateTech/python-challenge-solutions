# **PYTHON MICRO AND MACRO TASK SOLUTION**

# **Overview**

This repository holds all the submissions made for the Python Challenges Repository.

_Welcome, this project aim is to provide you with micro and macro task while you learn new concepts in python. Is one thing to keep learning and is another thing to practice what you're learning. During my learning process, one of the question I do ask myself is "were and how can I practice this concept I just learnt now", this questions comes always when you're learning basics in programming, like VARIABLES, LOOPS, CONDITIONS, DATA TYPES etc. the tasks provided here will help you gain more understanding of concepts you learn, from beginners steps to advance._

## [The Challenges](https://github.com/CodedLadiesInnovateTech/python-challenges)

**Phase 1 (Basics)**

- [Python Basic 1(target >>1 week)](https://github.com/CodedLadiesInnovateTech/python-challenges/tree/master/Phase-1/Python%20Basic%201)
- More Coming

**Phase 2 (Data Structures and Algorithms)**

- Coming soon

**Phase 3 (Objects)**

- Coming soon

## Set Up

To set up this project, first fork this repository to your own account

Locate fork button and click on it.

Then go to your desktop and create a folder, name it {python-challenges-solution}.

Open the folder {python-challenges-solution}, right click and select the option gitbash here (ensure you have git installed).

To make the folder a git folder, run the following command

```sh
$ git init
```

Set up your origin and upstream remotes by running the following commands

```sh
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/{YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME}/python-challenges-solution.git
```

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/CodedLadiesInnovateTech/python-challenge-solutions.git
```

Pull the code to your project directory and set it up by running the following command

```sh
$ git fetch upstream
```

```sh
$ git checkout master
```

## Task Submission

- At the root directory, create a folder with your name
- Inside the folder you just created, crate another folder and name it the task phase you're in. eg <Phase 1>
- Inside the Phase folder, create another folder with the name of the category you're in. eg <Python Basic 1>
- Then inside the category folder paste all your solution .py file for that particular category.
- The structure should look like: [your_name]>>[the_phase]>>[category]>>solution_files
- Then go back to your git terminal and run the following commands:
```sh
$ git add -A
```
```sh
$ git commit -m "your commit message"
```
```sh
$ git pull origin master
```
```sh
$ git push origin master
```
- And finally, go to your forked repository and make a pull request to the upstream repository 


## Note:

To make sure you have the latest task and to update your local repository with your forked repository, run this command at least before solving or pushing new solution.

```sh
$ git pull origin master
```
## HAPPY CODING!!
